# EasyRPG Maker | Application Bundles for macOS 

Simple, pre-made application bundles for popular RPG Maker 2000 / 2003 games. 

## Installation

Just mount the .dmg file and drag and drop to Applications. That easy. 

## Games

```
Ib | by kouri v1.07

## Releases/Downloads

None yet, I'll upload them soon :)

## M1 Support

Sadly, EasyRPG Maker doesn't have native M1 support. 
If it does at a later date, I'll be sure to add ARM compatiable releases. 

## RPGMaker VX When????

Man I wish...
But I do have future plans to get them working on macOS in some shape or form.
I'll be seeing if there is any way to get RPG Maker 95 games to run too. I just want Palette by Yoshitaka Nishida to run.
